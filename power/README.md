Dynaco PAS-3 Capacitor Board
==========================================

This board replaces the large can capacitor in the power supply section of the Dynaco PAS-3 preamplifier, as well as the selenium filament rectifier and 
the two large filament filter caps. Exact replacements for the original can capacitors are difficult to find. The board uses readily available PCB through hole capacitors.
